# Feedforward Neural Network 

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a feedforward neural network. It is designed to showcase the fundamentals of neural network architecture, including layers, activation functions, and the training process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib (for visualization), possibly others depending on the notebook's content (e.g., pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for dataset loading and preprocessing)

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas sklearn
```

## Usage

To run the feedforward neural network project:
1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook feedforward_nn.ipynb
```
3. Run through the cells sequentially to observe the network's setup, training, and evaluation process.
